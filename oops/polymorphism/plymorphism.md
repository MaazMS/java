1. Poly means many and morphism means form.  
2. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphism. 
3. The ability of an object to take on many forms. 
 
 Explain  
 shape class extends by different class such as circle,triangle,rectangle etc. 
 very object of child class have different form. but all are extends by shape class. 
 
 example 1. 
 Bank class have child class SBI bank, ICICI bank, central bank etc these are all child class have different 
 form and extends bank class  
 
 example 2 
 water class have child class solid,liquid and gas these define water characteristic and have different form 
 
 Types of polymorphism  
 
 1. Compile time ploymorphismm 
 2. Runtime polymorphism  
 
 Compile time ploymorphism also called as static polymorphism .It's achieve by method overloading that means 
 same method name in one class . 
 
 Condition of method overloading 
 1. Multiple method of same name in one class. 
 2. Sequence of argument different
 3. Number of argument (1 argument, 2 argument, 3 argument etc )
 4. Type of argument (number of argument is same but data type of argument is different ). 
 
 Runtime polymorphism is also called as dynamic polymorphism.It's achieve by method overriding that means same
 method name in parent class child class. 
 
 Condition of overriding 
 1. Multiple method of same name name in parent class and child class.
 2. Sequence of argument are same. 
 3. Number of argument are same (1 argument, 2 argument, 3 argument etc.)
 4. Type of argument are same  
 
 AutoPromotion 
 
 Definition 
 	One Type is promoted to another implicitly if no matching data type is found.
